# Pogos LLC Software Engineering Exercise - Pipe17 project

## Overview
Let us imagine we operate a highly popular product stand at the local farmerâ€™s market, offering a variety of products that customers love.
However, managing inventory, sales, loyalty programs, and customer interactions has become a major challenge.
To streamline operations and eliminate paper-based processes, we seek an application to simplify these tasks.

## Core Use Case
- Customers select products
- Products are weighed and priced
- Customers make payments and receive the receipts and change
- The same customers may return for additional purchases

## Current Challenges
- Managing high customer traffic and product browsing
- Inefficient inventory tracking relying on paper records
- Applying variable discounts to total order sales
- Pricing products based on weight
- Implementing daily discounts on specific products
- Managing rewards for customers with frequent visits

## What We're Looking For
Design a data model and API for the order creation and sending paycheck to client. The technology stack should include Node.js and Prisma preferred for the database.

### Possible Scenarios (Optional)
- Customer management
- Employee tracking
- Product inventory management
- Inventory tracking
- Variable pricing based on weight
- Daily discounts on specific products
- Loyalty program management
- Customer, inventory, and sales reporting
- Digital receipts
